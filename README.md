# Atlan Agent Toolkit

The Atlan Agent Toolkit is a groundbreaking initiative that bridges the gap between AI agents and Atlan's powerful data catalog and governance capabilities. Built on top of the [pyatlan][pyatlan-sdk] SDK and implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), this toolkit enables AI agents to interact with enterprise data assets in a secure, governed, and contextual manner.

## Context & Vision

### Why Atlan Agent Toolkit?

In the modern data landscape, organizations face several challenges:

1. **Data Discovery & Context**: Data practitioners spend significant time searching for the right data assets and understanding their context
2. **Governance & Compliance**: Ensuring AI agents interact with data in compliance with organizational policies and regulations
3. **Integration Complexity**: Difficulty in connecting AI/ML tools with enterprise data catalogs and metadata
4. **Contextual Intelligence**: Need for AI agents to understand and utilize rich metadata, lineage, and relationships between data assets

The Atlan Agent Toolkit addresses these challenges by:

- **Intelligent Data Discovery**: Enabling AI agents to semantically search and understand data assets using natural language
- **Contextual Understanding**: Providing agents with rich metadata context including lineage, relationships, and business context
- **Governed Access**: Ensuring AI interactions respect data governance policies, access controls, and compliance requirements
- **Standardized Communication**: Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for consistent and reliable interaction between AI models and Atlan services

### Current Capabilities

The toolkit currently supports:

- **MCP Integration**: Native support for the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
- **Atlan API Access**: Direct integration with Atlan's comprehensive API suite
- **Identity & Access**: Tools for user and group management within Atlan
- **Metadata Management**: Capabilities for working with Atlan's rich metadata system
